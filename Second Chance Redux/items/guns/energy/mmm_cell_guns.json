    "description": "One of Minuteman Munitions' several \"Vendor guns\", the Revere was meant to be dispensed from vending machines as a last ditch weapon for use against terrorists and mass shooters. Like many MMM weapons, their use in that purpose is hotly debated, but unlike many MMM guns, which end up as little more than a range toy, the Revere has become popular as a Concealed Carry option due to being an energy weapon. Being around the size of a derringer of old while having shots potent on the levels of high-caliber magnums, its energy density is unparalelled in the civilian space. It carries two MMM power cells, and can fire one or both simultaneously, a feature the marketing advertised as \"one if by land, two if by sea\".",
